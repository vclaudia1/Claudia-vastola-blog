## III – Analysis table about the study:


**Researchers?** 

National Institutes of Health and the MIT School of Science Sloan Fund. (Mei Hong, Venkata Mandala and Alexander Shcherbakov and Aurelio Dregni, and Antonios Kolocouris)


**Published in? when (if mentioned)?**  


Massachusetts Institute of Technology 


**General topic**  

Chemists have determined the molecular structure of a protein found in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 


**Procedure/what was examined** 


1. The binding sites of two drugs:
    * Block the channel but only weakly
    * Not be effective inhibitors of the E protein
2. Influenza B M2
    * Which taught them how to clone, express, and purify a virus membrane protein from scratch
    * Perfect training ground for studying SARS-CoV-2 E
    
3. Clone and purify the E protein 
    * In two and half months
    * Structure:
        - Embedded it into a lipid bilayer and then analyzed it with NMR
        - Assembles into a bundle of five helice
        - Create a tight channel
4. Amino acids at one end of the channel that may attract positively charged ions (calcium) 
5. Two drugs :
    * Amantadine, used to treat influenza
    * Hexamethylene amiloride, used to treat high blood pressure
    * Can block the entrance of the E channel
    * But only weakly 


    
**Conclusions/discovery**   

The molecular structure of a protein in the SARS-CoV-2 virus:


- Forms a cation-selective channel
- Virus's ability to replicate itself 
    
    
**Remaining questions**  How to block the channel?
