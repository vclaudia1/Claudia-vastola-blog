```{r setup}
SciViews::R
```

```{r importation}
urchin_bio <- read("urchin_bio", package = "data.io", lang = "AN")
```

The following graphic is about urchins

```{r graphique}
chart(data = urchin_bio, weight ~ origin %fill=% origin) +
  geom_violin()
```
This graphic shows that wild sea urchins are less heavy then the farm urchins. 
We can see that the fishery ones do not weight more than 75g and the farm ones can go up to 100g.
