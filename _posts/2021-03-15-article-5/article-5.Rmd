## III – Analysis table about the study:


**Researchers?**

**General topic**  


Vaccinated people tend to carry less virus in their bodies than unvaccinated people and can curb the coronavirus’s spread, not just prevent people from getting seriously ill. 


**Procedure/what was examined** 


* People vaccinated with Pfizer’s shots and who still get infected with the coronavirus carry less virus in their bodies
1. Clinical trial:
    * Pfizer’s vaccine had 95 percent efficacy to prevent COVID-19 symptoms
    * Comparison of the levels of virus in more than 15,000 coronavirus test samples
    * Samples that tested positive for the coronavirus from people over age 60 had lower levels of the coronavirus
    * Use of computational analyses 

2. In a separate study:
    * People who got infected within the 12 days following their first Pfizer shot and had little to no protection against COVID-19 have more coronavirus in the body 

3. Past studies:
    * When there is less virus in the body, a person is less likely to pass on coronavirus to others compared with people with a higher viral load. 
    * Vaccinated people who still get infected have less virus than unvaccinated people


**Conclusions/discovery**   

 
Pfizer’s vaccine might reduce the spread of coronavirus.
